To run the program:
(1) cd into the file, then in terminal, execute:
  npm install
it will install all the 3rd party needed in this program.
(2) Then run the program with:
  node app.js [area code]
 
Now the program is not complete, for it does not have a user interface, and user can only get weather information by typing the 
area code, further improving is to be done.
